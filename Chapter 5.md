## 5.1 Overview

### Routing table and flow table maintenance methods: 

#### Per-router control:
- Each router runs a routing algorithm
- Each router contains both forwarding and routing capabilities.

### Logically centralized control:





## 5.2 Routing algorithms

### 5.2.1 Link-State routing algorithms

### 5.2.2 Distance-Vector routing algorithms

## 5.3 Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) for routing within autonomous systems (ASes)

## 5.4 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for routing between ISPs

## 5.5 Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Control Plane

## 5.6

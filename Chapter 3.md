## 4.1 Network Layer Overview
- Dataplane: Forwarding
- ControlPlane: Routing decision
- Traditional approach: Routers communicate with each other to calculate the values for the forwarding table.
- SDN(Software Defined Networking) approach: A remote controller is used to calculate and distribute the forwarding table.
- Guaranteed delivery, possibly with an upper bound on delay and services for ordered packet delivery.
- Network service model ensures minimum bandwidth and security.
- Internet network layer service model: Best-effort service
